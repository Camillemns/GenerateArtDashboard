# Data Visualisation using Dash

I used a dataset from kaggle :
[Best Artwork of All Time](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time#__sid=js0)
You will have to download this dataset and unzip it in a folder named 'assets'.

## Installation

You need to have some librairies in order to execute this code. They are :
* dash
* dash-core-components
* dash-html-components
* plotly
* pandas

You can find detail on all the dependencies I had on my computer in the file requirements.txt.

You can do to install them all :
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

I used pip version 21.0.1 and python 3.9.1 on windows.

## Running

To run the dashboard do :
```bash
python dashboard.py
```

And go to http:/127.0.0.1:8050/ or click [here](http:/127.0.0.1:8050/).

ENJOY!
